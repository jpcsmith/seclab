Todo:	- Check that important events were logged
	- Configure logging
	- Write tests for generateCRL, revokeCert, and storeCRL

Caveats:	- Verification procedure may fail if the certificate expired between the start of the user's TLS session and the verify call at the CA resulting in a failed call.
	- The infrastructure certificates are not in the database and do not count towards the statistics issued.
	- Serial numbers may be skipped as the CA may issue a certificate and consume the serial key but then discard it due to a further error.
	- Since the DB does not use transactions, we may have archived private keys for certificates that were never issued.

Security:	- We could use xml schema to define the response from the CA, that way we may be able to protect ourselves from malform xml documents.
	- DB Queries are not generalised, they make assumptions on existence of uid or serial number, since they are not called otherwise.
	- Concurrency is not supported
	- Should probably pass the cipherlist to the  mysqld command to prevent someone overwriting it via system variables
	- We use parameterized queries, not prepared statements, same benefit to preventing XSS
